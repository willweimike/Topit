### Usage: 
- Topit can pin windows from any application to the top of your workspace.

- Topit can pin any number of windows. You can move, resize or interact with them at any time.  

## Q&A
**1. Why does Topit need screen recording and accessibility permissions?**
> Topit uses the accessibility permissions and screen recording permissions to control and capture your windows.  

**2. Does Topit consume a lot of power?**
> Topit uses ScreenCapture Kit to capture windows with a lower CPU overhead. But it may still drain the battery faster when you pin too many windows.
